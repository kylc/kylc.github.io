  <h2>Biomarker Detection App</h2>
  <p>
    Two other computer science students and I worked with the <a href="#">OSU
     Remcho Research Group</a> to develop an iPhone application to monitor
    biological indicator slides as they develop and process the results. The app
    greatly reduces the time requried to perform these tests in a number of labs
    that use them, and makes the testing procedure much more mobile allowing it
    to be used outside of a lab setting.

    The project won first place at the 2014 OSU App Challenge.

  <h2>OSU Aerial Robotics Team</h2>
  <p>
    As team lead in the 2013-2014 school year, I was responsible for overseeing
    the mechanical, electrical, and software teams. We developed a vehicle
    capable of autonomous flight. For the 2014-2015 school year, I was in charge
    of the firmware team. I developed flight control firmware in C++ for a range
    of ARM microcontrollers.

  <h2>Exoskeleton Robotic Arm</h2>
  <p>
    For the Spring 2014 OSU Hardware Weekend my team designed an exoskeleton arm. While other arm designs requrie expensive motors and gearboxes, ours uses a cheap brushless motor and a 3D printed cycloidal gearbox. The entire project was completed in just 30 hours.

  <h2>Speedy Car</h2>
  <p>
    For the Winter 2014 OSU Hardware Weekend we designed a car powered by four brushless multicopter motors. The intent was simply to build the fastest car possible in the allotted time. While we were never able to unleash its full potential, we had a lot of fun on slippery floors. We used our aerial flight control software and hardware stack to control the car through a wireless link to a laptop with a joystick.

  <h2>Volumetric Display</h2>
  <p>
    For the Fall 2014 OSU Hardware Weekend my team built a 3D volumetric persistence of vision display. The design features six microcontroller development board with 64 LEDs each. The lighting contraption is spun by a brushless motor to create the persistent effect.
